# ü¶Ä Learning Rust ‚Äì Basic

This repository contains my hands-on journey through learning the Rust programming language.  
Each folder under `basic/` or `oop/` represents a small focused topic, covering one key concept in Rust.

## üì¶ How to Run

Each folder is an independent Rust project. To run a specific one:

```bash
cd basic/<project-name> # or cd oop/<project-name>
cargo run
